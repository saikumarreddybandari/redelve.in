                                        The focus of this article is to examine the public health and economic
                                        consequences of declining childhood vaccination, a result of a growing vaccine
                                        hesitancy movement using the example of the MMR vaccination rates and measles
                                        virus rates1. Physical, cultural and religious, financial, emotional and
                                        educational barriers influencing Immunization acceptance will be identified.

                                        The World Health Organization (WHO) recently labeled people’s reluctance or
                                        refusal to become vaccinated as one of the top ten threats to global health in
                                        2019 and is one of the leading contributors to global child mortality. 2,3

                                        Although the United States (US) had achieved measles elimination in 2000,
                                        outbreaks have since occurred in the US and continue to occur globally.4,5,6,7.
                                        These outbreaks are exacting a hefty toll on local and state health departments,
                                        draining resources and siphoning health care workers from other needs.

                                        The World Health Organization recently labeled people’s reluctance or refusal to
                                        become vaccinated as one of the top ten threats to global health in 2019.2
                                        Although the US had achieved measles elimination in 2000 (as declared by the
                                        Center for Disease Control (CDC) and recognized by WHO), outbreaks have since
                                        occurred in the US and continue to occur globally. 5,6,7 The Measles outbreaks
                                        are due to several identified causes as discussed in this article.

                                        Immunization rates in the US, though improving, remain below target despite
                                        readily available effective and safe vaccines. This risks the resurgence of many
                                        infectious diseases with public health and economic consequences. Many ethicists
                                        believe that vaccination is not a merely a matter of personal choice, but it is
                                        also a social obligation.2 Immunization benefits not only the individual but
                                        society as a whole; as disease in any part of this country is a threat to
                                        everyone.

                                        Parental vaccine hesitancy and non-medical exemption allowances (NME) are major
                                        factors in low immunization rates and the alarming recurrence rate of serious,
                                        preventable illness, such as Measles.8 To ensure population-based herd immunity,
                                        95% of the population need to be vaccinated.8 Low immunization rates place even
                                        greater risk to persons who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons: those too
                                        young to be fully vaccinated, and those whom vaccines do not provide complete
                                        protection, such as the immuno-compromised patient.9 Studies show that response
                                        to Measles vaccination is reduced in malnourished children.10 Immunization rates
                                        are lowest in our poorest populations, such as immigrant, inner city and
                                        American Indian children, compounding the problem.

                                        Measles importation is another significant cause of measles persistence in the
                                        US. Unvaccinated US residents returning from trips abroad comprised the
                                        overwhelming majority of imported measles cases in the US as opposed to foreign
                                        visitors. Over two thirds of US resident cases reported during 2009-2014 had a
                                        philosophical or religious objection to immunization. It is mainly for these
                                        reasons that low immunization rates contribute to health and economic burdens,
                                        making improving immunization rates a public health priority. Federal, state and
                                        local government share in the responsibility for improving these deficiencies.
                                        Measles outbreak control requires intensive public health responses to contain
                                        them.

                                        Measles once eliminated in the US as of 2000 has had a resurgence and now an
                                        epidemic due to immunization aversion. The focus of this paper is to examine the
                                        potential public health and economic consequences of declining childhood
                                        vaccination, a result of a growing vaccine hesitancy movement using the example
                                        of the MMR vaccination rates and measles virus rates.1 This paper will identify

                                        Measles (Rubeola) is caused by the morbillivirus and is extremely contagious. It
                                        is recognized by its classic red rash (Koplik spots) which covers most of the
                                        body.4,12,5

                                        Measles patients are contagious for 4 days prior and 4 days after the rash
                                        appears. The virus remains viable in the air for up to 2 hours. Exposure of
                                        unvaccinated, previously unexposed individuals will result in 90% transmission
                                        spread primarily through cough and sneeze. Patients feel extremely ill for
                                        approximately 7 days and up to 30% will suffer some sort of complication: 8%
                                        diarrhea, 7-9% ear infections which can result in permanent hearing loss, 1-6%
                                        pneumonia, .1- .3% encephalitis causing death in adults. A 5% death rate in
                                        children was found in medically underserved areas. 4,11,5,13

                                        Measles illness during pregnancy has associated significant risks: maternal
                                        morbidity and premature labor, spontaneous abortion, low birth weight infants,
                                        premature birth and high risk of fetal loss. Measles in late pregnancy can lead
                                        to perinatal infection in the infant, which has a high risk of subacute

                                        In the 9th century, a Persian doctor published one of the first written accounts
                                        of measles disease. Francis Home, a Scottish physician, demonstrated in 1757
                                        that measles is caused by an infectious agent in the blood of patients.6

                                        In 1912, measles became a nationally notifiable disease in the United States,
                                        requiring U.S. healthcare providers and laboratories to report all diagnosed
                                        cases. In the first decade of reporting, an average of 6,000 measles-related
                                        deaths were reported each year.6

                                        In the decade before 1963 when a vaccine became available, nearly all children
                                        got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. It is estimated 3 to 4
                                        million people in the United States were infected each year. Among reported
                                        cases, an estimated 400 to 500 people died, 48,000 were hospitalized, and 1,000
                                        suffered encephalitis (swelling of the brain) from measles.6

                                        Childhood vaccines for common communicable diseases, such as measles, are among
                                        the most beneficial health care interventions worldwide.15

                                        In 1954, John F. Enders and Dr. Thomas C. Peebles collected blood samples from
                                        several ill students during a measles outbreak in Boston, Massachusetts. The
                                        objective was to isolate the measles virus in the student’s blood and create a
                                        measles vaccine. They succeeded in isolating measles in 13-year-old David
                                        Edmonston’s blood.6

                                        In 1963, John Enders and colleagues transformed their Edmonston-B strain of
                                        measles virus into a vaccine and licensed it in the United States. In 1968, an
                                        improved and less concentrated vaccine, developed by Maurice Hilleman and
                                        colleagues, began to be distributed. This vaccine, known as Edmonston-Enders
                                        (formerly “Moraten”) strain has been the only measles vaccine used in the United
                                        States since 1968.6 Measles vaccine is usually combined with mumps and rubella
                                        (MMR), or combined with mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV). The measles vaccine
                                        is effective 72 hours after administration.16

                                        In 1978, CDC set a goal to eliminate measles from the United States by 1982.6
                                        Although this goal was not met, the measles vaccine drastically reduced the
                                        disease rates. By 1981, the number of reported measles cases were reduced by 80%
                                        compared with the previous year. In 1989 measles outbreaks among vaccinated
                                        school-aged children prompted the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
                                        (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American Academy of
                                        Family Physicians (AAFP) to recommend a second dose of MMR vaccine for all
                                        children.16 Implementation of this recommendation and improvements in first-dose
                                        MMR vaccine coverage, showed reported measles cases declined even further.6

                                        The US had achieved measles elimination in 2000 (as declared by the Center for
                                        Disease Control (CDC) and recognized by WHO). Measles elimination is defined as
                                        the absence of continuous disease transmission for greater than 12 months.

                                        in 28 states . These outbreaks are taking a heavy toll on local and state health
                                        departments, draining resources and siphoning health care workers from other

                                        have altered immunity due to immunosuppression therapy and cancer treatments,
                                        and those who did not develop a protective response to vaccination.17

                                        Although the US had achieved measles elimination in 2000, outbreaks have
                                        occurred in the US and continue to occur globally. Measles outbreak control
                                        requires intensive public health responses to contain them. Early recognition of
                                        the illness is critical to limiting the transmission. A committed global effort
                                        to eradicate measles as well as ensure the US maintains a high 2-dose
                                        vaccination coverage and reducing and monitoring the rates of vaccine exemption
                                        will be essential to achieve measles elimination.11

                                        Unimmunized people are a threat to everyone. Vaccine hesitancy is a global
                                        problem. Increases in vaccine preventable diseases has been observed in many
                                        countries.18 WHO tracks cases globally, indicating 20 million cases of measles
                                        occur annually. Numerous outbreaks with tens of thousands of cases reported on
                                        multiple continents, including those countries that US residents travel to
                                        frequently, have been documented.

                                        WHO has 194 Member states; all of these are also member states of the United

                                        As of April 2019, measles cases have continued to climb. Preliminary global data
                                        shows that reported cases rose by 300 % in the first 3 months of 2019, compared
                                        to the same period in 2018, which follows consecutive increases over the past
                                        two years.22 (24) Current outbreaks include: Democratic Republic of the Congo,

                                        and Ukraine. In recent months spikes in number of cases have also occurred in
                                        countries with high overall vaccination coverage (US, Israel, Thailand, Tunisia)
                                        where disease has spread among clusters of unvaccinated people.20

                                        WHO estimates that less than 1 in 10 cases are reported globally. Considering
                                        this, to date, 2019 has 170 countries report 112,163 measles cases. As of this
                                        time last year, 28,124 cases were reported from 163 countries. Globally this is
                                        a 300% increase. WHO African region has recorded a 700% increase, Region of the

                                        Measles is preventable through two doses of vaccine. 2018 reports show that for
                                        the past several years global first dose measles vaccine coverage of children
                                        (by their second birthday) has held steady at 85%, far below the 95% needed to
                                        prevent outbreaks. 22. 171 countries report second dose coverage stands at 67%.

                                        WHO recommends that every child receive 2 doses of measles vaccine as studies
                                        have shown a low serologic response of 72% after single dose vaccine.23.
                                        Coverage of the second dose vaccine needs to increase globally. Today, 25
                                        countries still need to make the 2nd dose a part of their essential immunization
                                        program. 24,25,19,26

                                        In 1998 the LANCET published a British study by Dr. Andrew Wakefield and his
                                        associates linking Autism to MMR and other vaccines. This study was discredited
                                        and now retracted. Wakefield was accused of misrepresenting or altering the
                                        medical histories of all 12 of the patients whose cases formed the basis of the
                                        1998 study. A review of Wakefield’s study shows that of the 12 cases Wakefield
                                        examined in his paper, five showed developmental problems before receiving the
                                        MMR vaccine and three never had autism. According to British Medical Journal,
                                        Wakefield received more than 435,000 pounds ($674,000) from the lawyers who
                                        planned to use the study to sue the vaccine manufacturers. Wakefield has been
                                        unable to reproduce his results in the face of criticism, and other researchers
                                        have been unable to match them. In 2010 Britain stripped Wakefield of his
                                        medical license.

                                        Unfortunately, the article has done long-lasting damage to public health. This
                                        discredited paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of
                                        children immunized with MMR vaccine. Vaccination rates dropped sharply in
                                        Britain after its publication, falling as low as 80% by 2004. Measles cases have
                                        gone up sharply in the ensuing years. In the US, more cases of measles were
                                        reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997, and more than 90% of those
                                        infected had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown
                                        according to the CDC.27

                                        According to the CDC about 50% of imported measles cases in the US are from
                                        unvaccinated US residents who were infected abroad in countries where measles is

                                        Since MMR reached widespread use, measles cases in the US reduced by more that
                                        99%. Measles was declared eliminated (absence of continuous disease transmission
                                        for greater than 12 months) from the United States in 2000 and maintenance of
                                        elimination was verified in 2011. This was due to a highly effective vaccination
                                        program in the US, as well as better measles control in the Americas

                                        Globally, 20 million cases of measles occur annually. Numerous outbreaks with
                                        tens of thousands of cases reported on multiple continents, including countries
                                        that are visited frequently by US residents. The top 10 out bound destinations
                                        for US resident’s international travel are: Mexico, Canada, Dominican Republic,
                                        France, Italy, Jamaica, Spain and China; making up 77.1% of international
                                        travel. The top 10 home countries for international travel to the US accounting
                                        for 78.5% of international travel is Canada, Mexico, UK, Japan, Brazil, China,
                                        Germany, France, South Korea and Australia.28 Measles vaccination coverage rates
                                        for the top US resident international travel were generally lower than that of
                                        the US and the average incidence of measles in travel destinations was higher
                                        than that of the US. The total number of US residents travelling to countries
                                        with high measles incidence is 10 times higher than that of the cumulative
                                        number of unauthorized immigrants living in the US coming from countries with
                                        high measles incidence.28 The risk of measles importations from unauthorized
                                        immigrants to the US is low in comparison to the documented risk from cases
                                        imported by US residents traveling to measles-endemic areas. Measles outbreaks
                                        in the US have been linked to intentionally unvaccinated children who travelled
                                        to countries where measles outbreaks were occurring. 28. This emphasizes the
                                        need for international travelers to follow the CDC recommendations for measles
                                        vaccination prior to travel.

                                        Unvaccinated persons comprised the overwhelming majority of cases and outbreaks
                                        during 2009-2014 and over two thirds of US resident cases were reported as

                                        political and religious ideologies.28,11 The highest incidence occurred in
                                        children aged 12-15 months demonstrating the increased risk of young children
                                        around the age recommended for the first MMR dose.11 Efforts to decrease the
                                        risk of measles in the US should focus on appropriate routine and travel
                                        specific vaccination for US residents traveling internationally. This highlights
                                        the need for international travelers to follow the CDC recommendations for
                                        measles vaccination prior to travel.28

                                        Non-Medical exemption (NME) allowances by states have contributed to low
                                        vaccination rates. According to the 2015 National Immunization Survey, only 72%
                                        of children aged 19 to 35 months in the US were fully vaccinated as per
                                        guidelines of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, due to parental
                                        concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. Many families choose to opt out
                                        their children from vaccinations required for school entry by obtaining NMEs
                                        based on religious or philosophical beliefs. Since 2009 the number of
                                        “philosophical belief” NMEs has risen in 12 of 18 states that currently allow
                                        the policy.1 Review of federal and state Constitutional laws find that religious
                                        and personal belief exemptions to school-entry vaccine mandates are not
                                        constitutionally required.32 The legal justification for mandatory vaccination
                                        policy was announced in 1905 us Supreme Court case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts.
                                        The Supreme court determined that the government has the authority to restrict
                                        the liberty of adult citizens by compelling vaccination in order to prevent the
                                        spread of life-threatening contagious disease. This law is still in force
                                        today.32
                                    </p>

                                        In the US there are three types of legal exemptions to vaccination requirements:
                                        medical exemptions, religious exemptions, and personal belief or philosophical
                                        exemptions. All states allow some type of vaccine exemption if parents can
                                        provide certification from a licensed practitioner documenting medical
                                        contraindication for specific vaccines.32
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        All states allow religious exemption except for Mississippi, West Virginia, and
                                        California. Unfortunately, states have had additional legislative developments
                                        to allow greater protection for religious exemption. In most of the religious
                                        exemption states, parents simply check a box on an exemption request form. Since
                                        October 2017, seventeen states allow “philosophical” or “personal belief”
                                        exemptions which do not have to be religiously based. These exemptions have
                                        become known as “exemptions of convenience” as it is easier for parents to check
                                        a box than to obtain the immunizations. Oregon and Washington have restricted
                                        philosophical exemptions due to high non-vaccination rates.32

                                        Olive et al analyzed the relationship between NME and vaccine coverage. They
                                        found an inverse association between NME rate and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)
                                        vaccine coverage of kindergarteners in these states. This shows that states with
                                        higher overall NME rates have lower MMR vaccine coverage and state closure of
                                        NMEs has resulted in an increase of MMR coverage.33

                                        Strict policy changes have resulted in significant reduction in NME rates.
                                        Philosophical-belief NME prohibitions proved to be an effective policy
                                        intervention in some states. Other states have attempted to decrease the NME
                                        rate through less stringent means. Currently there are ongoing policy debates at
                                        the state and national level, regarding legislation around NME for childhood
                                        vaccination. There is also a special government commission on vaccine safety
                                        which may affect vaccine coverage in the future.1

                                        Identifying what causes parents and caregivers to refuse or skip vaccinating
                                        their children is essential to develop strategies to improve vaccination
                                        coverage.34 The CDC recommends physicians ask about vaccination status at each
                                        visit, make a strong recommendation and ensure patients know the potential
                                        consequences of not protecting themselves.16

                                        Lack of recommended scheduled Immunizations to children due to inadequate public
                                        awareness, limited appreciation of the importance of beginning immunization at
                                        infancy and immunizing children at recommended ages, are major factors in the
                                        resurgence of a previously eradicated disease. Increasingly, American parents
                                        reject universally recommended immunizations citing concerns about the missing,

                                        Parents who refuse immunization for their children are often influenced by
                                        misleading information of vaccine risks found on the internet and in the media,
                                        such as allergic reactions or Autism.35 In reality, severe allergic reactions
                                        occur one in one million doses.9 A retrospective study found no link between the
                                        MMR vaccine and autism disorders, and that the decrease in MMR vaccination (or
                                        even withdrawal) did not influence the rate of autism.36

                                        Vaccine hesitancy is defined as a delay or refusal to accept vaccination based
                                        on personal beliefs despite availability.1 It is influenced by complacency,
                                        convenience and lack of confidence in vaccines.36 It has been identified as a
                                        variety of behavioral responses including refusal, delay, and alternative
                                        schedules. These parents are more likely to be white, married and of higher
                                        education and income, subscribe to natural parenting or natural living
                                        philosophies. They live in states that allow philosophical exemption from school
                                        immunization laws.35 State policy allows parents to opt out of the mandatory
                                        immunizations for school for religious, medical and in 19 states, philosophical
                                        reasons.34 This group believes that getting the natural disease is healthier and
                                        that multiple vaccines are unhealthy for the immune system. They also feel
                                        vaccine preventable disease risk is minimal, vaccines are harmful to children
                                        and that unvaccinated children are protected by vaccinated children.35 These
                                        parents believe that the safety of vaccines is uncertain; providers are
                                        undereducated about vaccine safety issues and that government and pharmaceutical
                                        industries are not trustworthy. They describe clinicians as “rank and file”
                                        providers who blindly follow government recommendations that are ultimately
                                        motivated by the pharmaceutical industry. This group is particularly fearful of
                                        vaccine additives.35

                                        Ambiguity aversion: These people find risks from known disease more acceptable
                                        than the less (but perceived ambiguous) risks from vaccine. Ambiguity results
                                        from conflicting information about immunization risks and leads to inaction,
                                        skepticism of medical information on risks and benefits of vaccines,
                                        exaggeration of vulnerability to side effects and anxiety. Anti-vaccine
                                        activists and media coverage of rare adverse reactions offer a frightening

                                        their susceptibility to disease to be much lower than others. They prefer
                                        natural products or substances that are less effective, or even harmful, because
                                        they are not “synthetic”. They are more biased against harmful acts like
                                        vaccination as opposed to harmful omission.36 This group does not believe in the
                                        effectiveness of vaccines and disagrees with recommendations for vaccination.
                                        They argue that the preventable illnesses are not as prevalent or as severe as

                                        workers are determined to be a clear and present danger to the health of others.
                                        For example, Influenza is contagious for 4 days before symptoms appear; yet 86%
                                        of health care workers report they have worked despite having flu like
                                        symptoms.36(3) In 1998, only 12% of all health care workers in the ICU and 15%
                                        neonatal nurses were vaccinated against influenza.36

                                        vaccination as a condition of employment; otherwise employees are to wear a mask
                                        while at work for the entire flu season. As a result, Influenza vaccination
                                        rates increqased from 30 to 98.9%.36. Measles antibody status should also be

                                        All health care workers now have the ability to practice at the top of their
                                        license to allow increased opportunity to provide immunizations. Currently the
                                        Center for Disease control has developed standing orders for pharmacists and
                                        nurses to provide immunizations within their scope of practice.37 Blum et al
                                        reports Project IMPACT(Improving America’s Communities Together) Immunizations
                                        project’s primary objective was to evaluate a practice model where pharmacists
                                        have access to patients’ vaccine history (IIS) at point of care. It was
                                        hypothesized that a significant percentage of people presenting to the pharmacy
                                        for an Influenza vaccination would have additional unmet vaccination needs. The
                                        pharmacist would be able to identify these needs and educate the patient at that
                                        time. Patients with those unmet needs would take advantage of the opportunity
                                        for additional vaccines. This study was performed in 8 small towns in rural
                                        Washington state during a 6-month window during 2015-2016 Influenza season.
                                        There were 1080 study patients, all over the age of 18 with an average age of
                                        62.5 years. Of the 1080 study patients, 1566 additional vaccines were also due
                                        at the time the patient was receiving the influenza vaccine. There were 36
                                        contraindications and 196 vaccines declined , leaving 1334 unmet vaccination
                                        needs. Of these 1334, one third were resolved during the 6-month study period.
                                        426 (95.3%) were provided by the pharmacist at point of care and the other 4.7%
                                        were provided at a patient-initiated follow-up visit.37

                                        Measles once eliminated in the US as of 2000 has had a resurgence and now an
                                        epidemic due to immunization aversion. This paper has examined the public health
                                        and economic consequences of declining childhood vaccination, a result of a
                                        growing vaccine hesitancy movement using the example of the MMR vaccination
                                        rates and measles virus rates.1 Physical, cultural and religious, financial,
                                        emotional, and educational barriers influencing Immunization acceptance have
                                        been identified.
